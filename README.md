## Introduction

Pako Grow is an innovative agricultural technology project aimed at empowering farmers with advanced tools and insights. Our mission is to transform traditional farming practices using cutting-edge technologies and data-driven solutions.

## Project Overview

Pako Grow comprises several key components, each addressing specific agricultural challenges:

- **Crop Anomaly Detection**: Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we provide farmers with the ability to detect anomalies in their crops, enabling early intervention and reduced crop loss.

- **Crop Recommendation**: Our system recommends suitable crops based on soil conditions, climate, and other factors, helping farmers make informed planting decisions.

- **Fertilizer Recommendation**: Farmers can input their crop and soil data to receive personalized fertilizer recommendations, optimizing crop growth and resource utilization.

- **Disease Prediction**: Using deep learning models, our platform predicts diseases affecting plant leaves from uploaded images, aiding in early detection and treatment.

- **Pako GPT Agriculture Chatbot**: Pako GPT is an intelligent chatbot that offers real-time agricultural guidance in Moroccan Arabic, answering farmers' queries and providing expert advice.

- **optimizing crop distribution**:  Simulation Of real Time data visualisation in  Power BI to visualize data, deriving insights crucial for optimizing crop distribution. We analyze crop distribution, assess soil and air conditions essential for robust crop growth, and examine the geographical positioning of farms across Morocco.

## Technologies

Our project leverages the following technologies:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Flask (for backend)
- Mistral-7b
- scikit-learn and other open-source libraries
- Azure
- Power Bi

## Getting Started

To use Pako Grow and its components, simply 
- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pako-grow.git
- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the Flask app: python app.py
  
We've designed it to be user-friendly and accessible to farmers of all backgrounds.
For the interface template is inspired from harvesty but we did add multiple features as you can see
